Dear Mr./Ms. CTO,

I have completed the HCI environment for our key e-commerce app.
I have performed the following tasks as prescribed by our key stakeholders.

First, in acccordance to your requirements, I have created a production environment
as well as a development environment for our teams in accordance to a 3-tier 
architecture consisting of the web server layer, the application layer, and 
the database layer. 

Most importantly, these environments can be flexibly configured by our teams,
allowing them to freely scale up vCPU and Memory resources without bottleneck.
I have enabled automatic snapshots of our production environment on an hourly 
basis so that they can be restored with at most an 1-hour downtime window
after a data loss or a failure.

The Production environment consists of
  Web layer         | web-prod | prod-net | C:\Images\CentOs
  Application layer | app-prod | prod-net | C:\Images\CentOs
  Database layer    | db-prod  | prod-net | C:\Images\Windows

The Development environment consists of
  Web layer         | web-dev | dev-net | C:\Images\CentOs
  Application layer | app-dev | dev-net | C:\Images\CentOs
  Database layer    | db-dev  | dev-net | C:\Images\Windows
  
I have also successfully confirmed the completion of the removal of a key VM 
(the DB prod vm) and being able to restore it using a full restoration within
the required time bound SLA.


As for the requirements of our Networking team, the following steps have been taken:
A managed network using IPAM/DHCP from an IP Pool has been created with the name
prod-net, along with an id of vlan 0, which contains a pool of IP addresses 
ranging from 172.31.0.210 to 172.31.0.23.

A unmanaged network has been created for the development environment with the name
dev-net, along with an id of vlan 101, which uses the 172.31.101.0/24 range.


And for our SysAdmin requirements, the NTP has been created under the public service
pool.ntp.org and 8.8.8.8 for the Domain Naming Service.  The VMs  images have 
been created using a Storage Container called Images, which contains a Windows 
and a CentOs image (uploaded from C:\Images directory).
Furthermore, each of the VMs has a configuration of 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM, with
the web and application VMs using the CentOs images while the database VM is
using the Windows image. 


I truly believe that this new HCI along with the configurations here will be
a major step for our company's agility, resilience and reduce our bottlenecks.

Should you have any further requests or questions, please feel free to let me know.

Sincerely,
Xu Ren
